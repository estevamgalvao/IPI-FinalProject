    """
    toonify converts an _image into a cartoonized version of it.
    The _image looks like it has been sketched.

    The function uses a few algorithms:
        1. median blur -> it is applied to reduce salt and pepper noise in the _image
        2. canny edge detection -> it is used to add edges in the final _image
        3. bilateral filter -> bilateral filter is applied to reduce the details in the _image
        4. color quantization -> the method reduces the number of colors and leads to clustering of colors
                                that give the desired color effect in the _image
    :param
        1. _image -> _image is the input for the function
        2. _canny_threshold_lower -> lower threshold value for Canny Edge Detection algorithm
        3. _canny_threshold_upper -> upper threshold value for Canny Edge Detection algorithm
        Note- The default thresholds give better results for portrait images.
        ...The thresholds maintain a balance on the number of edges visible on a face.

    :return:
    the function returns a tooned version of the _image
